# PPOD_CA
This repository contains a knowledge graph of PPOD information describing connections between
environmental conservation and the food system in California.

The repository consists of a single file, PPOD_CA.ttl, which is an RDF graph database in Turtle format. 
The data in this RDF file is in the [PPOD_FSL](https://github.com/PPODschema/PPOD_FSL) LinkML schema also hosted
in this GitHub organization. It has been generated using the Python script PPODtottl.py available in the [PPODtottl repository](https://github.com/PPODschema/PPODtottl). 

Data in this knowledge graph has been collected by Patrick Huber between 2018 and the present. Areas of 
focus include conservation resources of the Sacramento region and information on the Northern California
food system. 

The data in this knowledge graph is current as of 14 February 2025.

Partial funding for development of this database has come from the US National Science Foundation, 
NSF Award 1737573, in a Research Coordination Network project entitled “Developing Informational Infrastructure for 
Building Smart Regional Foodsheds”.
